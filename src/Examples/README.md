# Caesar Project - Examples

This folder contains example scripts related to the Caeser project. Each script serves a different purpose and may require specific datasets or dependencies to run correctly.

## Files and Their Purpose

1. **`siamese-Harshwandhan Fartale.py`**  
   This script is designed for training and testing a Siamese network. It requires a specific dataset for training. The dataset link and instructions for usage are provided below.
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pinxau1000/radioml2018

2. **`test_radar_synthetic-debajyoti sahoo.py`**  
   This script generates a synthetic data frame that can be used for testing with any suitable model. It acts as a utility for generating radar data and does not require a specific dataset.

3. **`PRI_paranidharan.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook that contains code with an inbuilt dataset, making it ready to run without any additional dataset requirements.

## To install requirement

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to Use Each Script

### 1. siamese-Harshwandhan Fartale.py

**Dataset Requirements**:  
The Siamese network script requires a dataset, which can be downloaded from [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pinxau1000/radioml2018).

**Running the Script**:
```bash
# Ensure you have the required dataset downloaded and placed in the correct directory.
# Then run the script using Python.
python siamese-Harsawantharfartale.py
```

### 2. test_radar_synthetic-debajyoti sahoo.py

```bash
# Ensure you have Python installed and configured.
# Simply run the script with Python using the command below.
python test_radar_synthetic-debajyoti sahoo.py
```
### 3. PRI_paranidharan.ipynb


How to Run the Notebook:
```bash
# Ensure you have Jupyter installed.
# Open the Jupyter Notebook by using the command below.
jupyter notebook PRI_paranidharan.ipynb
# Once the notebook is open, you can run all cells to execute the code.
